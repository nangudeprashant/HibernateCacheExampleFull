 * 		   Hibernate Query Cache to avoid amount of traffic between
 *         your application and database. The query cache is responsible for
 *         caching the results of queries. Let us have a look how Hibernate uses
 *         the query cache to retrieve objects. Note that the query cache does
 *         not cache the state of the actual entities in the result set; it
 *         caches only identifier values and results of value type. So the query
 *         cache should always be used in conjunction with the second-level
 *         cache. 
 *         The combination of the query and the values provided as
 *         parameters to that query is used as a key, and the value is the list
 *         of identifiers for that query. Note that this becomes more complex
 *         from an internal perspective as you begin to consider that a query
 *         can have an effect of altering associations to objects returned that
 *         query; not to mention the fact that a query may not return whole
 *         objects, but may in fact only return scalar values (when you have
 *         supplied a select clause for instance). That being said, this is a
 *         sound and reliable way to think of the query cache conceptually.
